# How will my friendships change when I have a baby and they do too? What about when I do and they don’t? 

You may have expected your social freedoms to change when your child made their way into the world, but the hardest part of this, the part you weren’t expecting, can sometimes be how your friendships change too. Sometimes when you and your friends both have kids, your relationship with them doesn’t go away, but the dynamics do change. It can be fun to have your kids hang out and get some time with your adult friends at the same time, but you’re also worried about their safety, and if there’s conflict between your kids, that can create conflict between you and your friend. This worry can be daunting, but it’s completely normal!

On the other hand, sometimes your friends will drift apart from you when you have kids and they don’t. This hurts a lot – were they your friend because they enjoyed you for who you are on the inside, or was it always a friendship of convenience? It’s hard to swallow, particularly when it happens with friendships you thought would last forever. Remember that it’s normal to have both deep, meaningful relationships and friendships of convenience. That doesn’t change the hurt when you find out one was not the type of relationship you thought, but it also means that some of these friendships come back into focus as your circumstances and time constraints change, or your friends’ do.

Don’t forget: you’re also going to find new adult friendships as your kids grow and start making friends of their own. Some of these friendships will last, and some won’t, but it’s natural for relationships to ebb and flow like this. Make sure you check in with yourself and make time for the people who see you and make time for you, too. Is someone showing up for you more than you expected them to? Maybe you can invest a little more energy in that relationship. Did someone you expected to be there for you fall through? Maybe give that friendship a little less of your energy – you have a finite amount of it, and it’s okay to save it for the people who are helping you the most. Boundaries like this are hard to set, but are healthy and will keep your mental health and sanity intact in a crazy time.
