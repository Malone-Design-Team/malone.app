### Who's in my Circle?

Caring for a new child can be a lot, and it's easy to forget to take care of yourself. Don't forget that there are always people that can help you through this experience.This is an activity to help you identify some of those people that you can reach out when you need help with the little things, after a paricularly bad day, or any time you just need an outlet and some extra support. Take a few minutes to think about the following questions or write down some of the thoughts that come to mind if that helps you. You can always come back to this activity, or where you might have written it down to remind yourself of your circle of support.

1) Who can you call when you need advice without fear of being judged or ridiculed?
2) Who can you count on to have your best interests in mind and advocate for you when needed?
3) Which people in your life make you feel most appreciated and empowered?
4) What attributes come to mind when you think of someone who is supportive? Who do you know that has some of those attributes?

These are the people that you can reach out to when you need help! Some people are going to be better than others at different things, so find ways to make it work for you and your situation. Don't forget: it takes a village, and that's normal.
