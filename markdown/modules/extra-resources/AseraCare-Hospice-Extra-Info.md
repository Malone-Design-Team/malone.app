Hospice Care: Physical, emotional and spiritual care at the end of life 

- Patients should [consider hospice](https://resources.amedisys.com/signs-aging-parents-need-hospice-care) when medical treatments can no longer cure their disease or when the burden of treating symptoms outweighs the benefits of treatment. Although end-of-life care can be difficult to discuss, talking about hospice early on allows you to make educated decisions and understand a loved one’s wishes before a crisis occurs.
