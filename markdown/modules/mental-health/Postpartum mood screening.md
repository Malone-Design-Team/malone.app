# Postpartum mood screening
---
Some [1 in 10 mothers](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/index.htm) experience postpartum mood disorders such as anxiety or depression. It is normal. This page includes resources on postpartum mood disorders and how to detect (that is, how to "screen for") them. There is no one perfect way to detect postpartum mood illnesses.

### Depression
A good resource to screen for depression is the **Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale** [(tap or click here)](http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/Documents/Resources/HealthPromotion/EPDS/EPDSScoringGuide_March2015.pdf). You can print and fill out this document as a way to check in with yourself. If you score 12 to 13 or above, consider seeking professional help.

### Anxiety
If you want to screen for anxiety, you could use the **Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale** [(tap or click here)](). It's another way of checking in with yourself, like the Edinburgh test, but for anxiety instead of depression. If you score 112 or greater, consider seeking professional help.

# Notes
It would probably be best if we included the relevant files in the app itself so that links to the resources don't run the risk of breaking.
It would also be good to include pictures and general polish to make this document look better than it does right now.
There is no link to the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale since I wasn't able to find a good one.
