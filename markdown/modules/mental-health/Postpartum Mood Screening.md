# Postpartum mood screening
---

Approximately [1 in 10 mothers](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/index.htm) experience postpartum mood disorders, such as anxiety or depression. This is a common experience. This page provides resources on postpartum mood disorders and guidance on how to screen for them. Please note that there is no single, perfect method for detecting postpartum mood illnesses.

### Depression
A good resource for screening for depression is the **Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale** [(tap or click here)](/pdf/EPDSQuestionnaireApril2013.pdf). You can print and fill out this document to check in with yourself. For scores of 12 or greater, consider seeking professional help.

### Anxiety
If you want to screen for anxiety, you could use the **Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale** [(tap or click here)](). It's another way of checking in with yourself, like the Edinburgh test, but for anxiety. If you score 112 or greater, consider seeking professional help.

# Notes
It would probably be best if we included the relevant files in the app itself so that links to the resources don't run the risk of breaking.
It would also be good to include pictures and general polish to make this document look better than it does right now.
There is no link to the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale since I wasn't able to find a good one.
