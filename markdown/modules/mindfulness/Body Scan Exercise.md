# Body Scan Exercise

* Find a place to lie down and stretch out in a comfortable position. Allow your eyes to close, and take a few deep, slow breaths to relax.
* Starting from the bottom of your body, slowly scan upwards, noticing any tension or discomfort.
* Breath into each area. Notice and acknowledge the sensations you feel in each part. Stretch them, wiggle them a little, and relax them as you go.
* The goal of this exercise is to focus on each part of your body individually to help ease tension from it. Being intentional about that focus and that stretch can help you quiet your thoughts and stay in the present moment.
* Sometimes this strategy is hard to use during the day, so try using it before you get out of the bed in the morning, or to relax right before you go to sleep (before a nap or at night).
