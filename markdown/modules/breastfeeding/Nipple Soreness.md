# What causes nipple soreness and what can you do to alleviate it?

Your nipples may feel sore or tender when breastfeeding, especially in the first week. The cause may not be obvious, but there are many things you can do to [reduce nipple soreness](https://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-challenges/common-breastfeeding-challenges):
- Your baby should suckle not just the nipple, but also the whole areola (the darker colored area around the nipple).
  - This may be happening if your nipple looks flat when your baby lets go. It should be round and long or the same shape it was before you started.
  - If you baby is only sucking the nipple, gently place your finger in the corner of their mouth to break suction then help them get a better latch. For more information, [Tap Here]() to read about getting a good latch.
- Try changing the position in which you hold your baby each time you feed them.
- Change nursing pads often or they may trap moisture that can lead to cracked nipples.
- If your nipples are dry or cracked, you can help keep them moist by letting them air-dry after feeding or wearing a soft cotton shirt.
  - After breastfeeding, you can express a small amount of milk and gently rub it onto your nipples.
  - You can also use a purified lanolin cream or ointment (it should be made specifically for breastfeeding).
- If you use any creams, hydrogel pads, or a nipple shield, make sure to ask your doctor first. Some people are not able to use these products.
- Avoid using harsh soaps or ointments that contain astringents. All you need to wash your breasts and nipples is clean water.
- Don't wear tight bras or clothes that put pressure on your nipples.
- If your nipples are very sore, you can ask your doctor about non-asprin pain relievers.
- If you're putting off feeding your baby because it is painful, this could harm your milk supply and cause more pain. Talk to your doctor or doula.
