# Week 1
## Health: Typical Postpartum
- You should contact your health care provider within 3 weeks of delivery.
- Know the expected postpartum symptoms and the symptoms of common pregnancy-related health complications (see FAQ topics)
    - Vaginal soreness is common after a vaginal delivery 
    - Vaginal bleeding will be heavy and bright red for the first few days. It will slowly get darker and more watery. 
        - Contact your doctor if blood from your vagina soaks through a pad in an hour for two hours or more, especially if you also have a fever, pelvic pain or tenderness, dizziness, or lightheadedness. 
    - You may feel contractions (called afterpains) for a few days after delivery. They are common during breastfeeding. 
    - You may find that you leak urine when you sneeze, laugh, or cough. This will usually end after one week, but can last longer. 
    - You may feel pain during bowl movements, swelling near your anus, or swollen veins around your anus or lower rectum. Make sure to drink water and eat foods high in fiber. 
    - For about 5 months, you will lose hair faster than it grows. 
    - It’s common to still look pregnant after giving birth. Over the course of several days, you’ll lose weight from leftover fluids. 
- Stretch marks can appear on the abdomen, breasts, hips, buttocks or other places on the body. 
    - They can be black, blue, purple, pink, red, or discolored streaks. 
    - They don’t need treatment and fade over time on their own.

## Health (mental / psychological) 
- At least 10% of women struggle with depression and anxiety after giving birth (postpartum mood disorders). Keep an eye out for this—it's normal and nothing to be ashamed of. 
    - Symptoms may include losing enjoyment in things, anxiety seemingly without reason, and others. 
- It’s important to practice mindfulness! *[link to definition of mindfulness here]*

# Breastfeeding 
- For a few days after giving birth, you might have full, firm, sore breasts. Breastfeed your baby often on both breasts to help keep them from overfilling.
