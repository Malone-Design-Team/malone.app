# Week 2
## Mental Health
Some [1 in 10 mothers](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/index.htm) experience postpartum mood disorders such as anxiety or depression. It is normal. This section includes resources on postpartum mood disorders and how to screen for them. There is no one perfect way to detect postpartum mood disorders.

A good resource to screen for depression is the **Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale** [(tap or click here)](http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/Documents/Resources/HealthPromotion/EPDS/EPDSScoringGuide_March2015.pdf).

## Finding Social Support
The most significant drop in relationship satisfaction is in the first 6 months of the postpartum period, aka right now. This is a normal part of having a new child, and it does not just happen for first time parents. There's usually a few reasons for this drop in satisfaction:
* You are spending a lot of the time that may have been devoted to your partner caring for your infant.
* Infants require a LOT of time, so naturally this means there's less time for uninterrupted attention and communication with your partner.
* You and your partner may experience a decrease in sexuality, changing the normal dynamics of your relationship.
* A lot of money goes towards raising a child, and sometimes the increase in expenses can cause additional stress.

Again, this is normal right after having a child, whether they're your first or not. Find a few people you trust - friends, family, coworkers, etc. - and don't hesitate to reach out to ask for help. Maybe they can watch your child for an hour or two to give you some time to yourself, or maybe they can stop by to help with dinner one night. Sometimes having a little help outside of your household can make things run smoother inside it.
Also try to be open with your partner about how you're feeling and what you need from them, and encourage them to do the same with you. This is a new experience for both of you, and the more you can share where you're at mentally, the easier it will be to find common ground, as well as areas where you can work through any struggles you're having.
