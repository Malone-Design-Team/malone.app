## Mental Health
Some [1 in 10 mothers](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/index.htm) experience postpartum mood disorders such as anxiety or depression. It is normal.

## Finding Social Support
The largest drop in relationship satisfaction happens in the first 6 months of the postpartum period, aka right now. This is a normal part of having a new child. It can happen to new and experienced parents alike! There's a few reasons for this drop in satisfaction:
- You may not be able to spend as much time with your partner now that you're caring for your infant.
- You may have less time for uninterrupted attention and communication with your partner.
- You and your partner may experience a decrease in sexuality, changing the normal dynamics of your relationship.
- A lot of money goes towards raising a child. The increase in expenses can cause additional stress.

Again, this is normal right after having a child, whether they're your first or not. So what can you do to make things a bit less stressful?
- Find a few people you trust - friends, family, coworkers, etc. - and don't hesitate to reach out to ask for help.
  - Maybe they can watch your child for an hour or two to give you some time to yourself, or they can stop by to help with dinner one night.
  - Sometimes having a little help outside of your household can make things run smoother inside it.
- Try to be open with your partner about how you're feeling and what you need from them. Encourage them to do the same with you.
- Remember, this is a new experience for you and your partner.
- The more you can share where you're at mentally, the easier it will be to find common ground.
- Make sure to talk about any struggles you're having so you can work through them together.
