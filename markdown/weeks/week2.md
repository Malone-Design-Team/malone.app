## Mental Health
Some [1 in 10 mothers](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/index.htm) experience postpartum mood disorders such as anxiety or depression. It is normal. This section includes resources on postpartum mood disorders and how to detect (that is, how to "screen for") them. There is no one perfect way to detect postpartum mood illnesses.

A good resource to screen for depression is the **Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale** [(tap or click here)](http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/Documents/Resources/HealthPromotion/EPDS/EPDSScoringGuide_March2015.pdf). You can print and fill out this document as a way to check in with yourself. If you score 12 to 13 or above, consider seeking professional help. If you want to screen for anxiety, you could use the **Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale** [(tap or click here)](). It's another way of checking in with yourself, like the Edinburgh test, but for anxiety instead of depression. If you score 112 or greater, consider seeking professional help. See our list of recommended professionals on the resources tab of this app.

## Mindfulness Exercises
Being a new parent is hard, and sometimes it can help to take a few steps back and breathe. Try this 4-7-8 breathing exercise to help you stay in the moment and get a few moments to relax. Note: the exact breathing times aren't important - the 4:7:8 ratio is what matters the most.
* Place the tip of your tongue against the ridge of tissue just behind your upper front teeth, and keep it there through the entire exercise. You will be exhaling through your mouth around your tongue; try pursing your lips slightly if this seems awkward. 
* Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound. 
* Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four. 
* Hold your breath for a count of seven. 
* Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound to a count of eight. 
* This is one breath. Now inhale again and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths.

## Finding Social Support
The most significant drop in relationship satisfaction is in the first 6 months of the postpartum period, aka right now. This is a normal part of having a new child, and it does not just happen for first time parents. There's usually a few reasons for this drop in satisfaction:
* You are spending a lot of the time that may have been devoted to your partner caring for your infant.
* Infants require a LOT of time, so naturally this means there's less time for uninterrupted attention and communication with your partner.
* You and your partner may experience a decrease in sexuality, changing the normal dynamics of your relationship.
* A lot of money goes towards raising a child, and sometimes the increase in expenses can cause additional stress.

Again, this is normal right after having a child, whether they're your first or not. Find a few people you trust - friends, family, coworkers, etc. - and don't hesitate to reach out to ask for help. Maybe they can watch your child for an hour or two to give you some time to yourself, or maybe they can stop by to help with dinner one night. Sometimes having a little help outside of your household can make things run smoother inside it.
Also try to be open with your partner about how you're feeling and what you need from them, and encourage them to do the same with you. This is a new experience for both of you, and the more you can share where you're at mentally, the easier it will be to find common ground, as well as areas where you can work through any struggles you're having.
