## Mental Health
- Anxiousness and mood swings following birth should subside within two weeks.
    - If you still find yourself experiencing these symptoms, talk to to your doctor.
    - If you are very tired, donâ€™t feel like eating, have trouble with daily tasks, have large mood swings, or feel like harming yourself or your child, be sure to tell your doctor. These may be symptoms of postpartum depression.
