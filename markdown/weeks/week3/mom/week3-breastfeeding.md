#### Breastfeeding

Avoid breastfeeding other mothers’ babies or allowing your baby to be breastfed by someone other than you in order to prevent the spread of disease. There’s also the possibility that another mothers’ milk contains medication that might not be healthy for your baby ​([link](https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/month-by-month/))​. Malone has a milk bank where donated milk is ensured to be safe and healthy, so if your baby needs a little extra, reach out!
