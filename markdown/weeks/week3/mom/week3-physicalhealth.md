#### Physical Health & Changes

After three weeks, you should begin to feel like you can move around normally again. Your body is still recovering, so don’t do anything strenuous, but everyday physical activities ought to be more-or-less easy for you. Vaginal bleeding should have stopped or at least be significantly less than before (more [here](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/postpartum-recovery))​. In the next few weeks, vaginal discharge will have less blood and will begin to taper off. It will turn from brown to yellow or white. If you had a second-degree vaginal tear, you should begin to feel better by this point ​(more [here](https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/parents/postpartum-recovery-timeline))​. Fecal incontinence may still be a problem, so be sure to eat food that are easy to digest and do your Kegel exercises (more [here](https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/month-by-month/))​.
