## Mindfulness

These exercises help keep you in the moment with all the stress of caring for your newborn, regulate your emotions, and reduce your anxiety levels. Some may work better than others for you, so feel free to look for more and reference past exercises - all of them can be found in the Modules tab under “Mindfulness.”

**Weekly Exercise**: Breath Counting 

* Sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight and your head inclined slightly forward. Gently close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Then let the breath come naturally without trying to influence it. Ideally, it will be quiet and slow, but depth and rhythm may vary.
* To begin the exercise, count “one” to yourself as you exhale.
* The next time you exhale, count “two,” and so on up to “five.”
* Then begin a new cycle, counting “one” on the next exhalation.
* Never count higher than “five,” and count only when you exhale. You will know your attention has wandered when you find yourself up to “eight,” “twelve,” or even “nineteen.” Try to do 10 minutes of this form of meditation in one sitting.
