## Mental Health
- Anxiousness and mood swings following birth should subside within two weeks.
    - If your partner still finds themselves experiencing these symptoms, encourage them to talk to their doctor.
    - If they are very tired, donâ€™t feel like eating, have trouble with daily tasks, have large mood swings, or feel like harming themselves or the baby, be sure to tell their doctor. These may be symptoms of postpartum depression.
- Would your partner like to connect with a BIPOC female therapist in Omaha? Here are some options and their contact information! *[insert link to therapist information]*
