###### Mental Health

Some [1 in 10 mothers](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/index.htm) experience postpartum mood disorders such as anxiety or depression. It is normal. This section includes resources on postpartum mood disorders and how to screen for them. There is no one perfect way to detect postpartum mood disorders.

- A good resource to screen for depression is the **Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale** ([here](/markdown/weeks/pdf/EPDSQuestionnaireApril2013.pdf)). Filling out this document is a great way to check in with yourself. If you score 12 to 13 or above, consider seeking professional help.
- If you want to screen for anxiety, you could use the **Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale** ([here)]()). If you score 112 or greater, consider seeking professional help.

If you are in a crisis, please call 988 (the emergency mental health line; itâ€™s like 911 but for mental health). More general mental health information can be found [here](/markdown/modules/mental-health). Otherwise, check out the Resources tab for a list of local mental health professionals vetted by Malone.
