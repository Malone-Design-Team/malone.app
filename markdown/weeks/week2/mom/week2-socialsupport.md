# Finding Social Support

The largest drop in relationship satisfaction happens in the first 6 months of the postpartum period, aka right now. This is a normal part of having a new child. It can happen to new and experienced parents alike! There's a few reasons for this drop in satisfaction:

* You may not be able to spend as much time with your partner now that you're caring for your infant.
* You may have less time for uninterrupted attention and communication with your partner.
* You and your partner may experience a decrease in sexuality, changing the normal dynamics of your relationship.
* A lot of money goes towards raising a child. The increase in expenses can cause additional stress.

Again, this is normal right after having a child, whether they're your first or not. So what can you do to make things a bit less stressful?

* Find a few people you trust - friends, family, coworkers, etc. - and don't hesitate to reach out to ask for help. Maybe they can watch your child for an hour or two to give you some time to yourself, or they can stop by to help with dinner one night. Sometimes having a little help outside of your household can make things run smoother inside it.
* Try to be open with your partner about how you're feeling and what you need from them. Encourage them to do the same with you.

Remember, this is a new experience for you and your partner. The more you can share where you're at mentally, the easier it will be to find common ground. Make sure to talk about any struggles you're having so you can work through them together.
