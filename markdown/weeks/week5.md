## Your Body Postpartum
- Between 6 and 12 weeks after birth, be sure to contact your health care provider for a comprehensive postpartum evaluation.
- At this evaluation, they will discuss:
    - Your emotional well-being
    - Contraception or future pregnancies
    - Infant care and feeding
    - Your sleep habits
- They will also perform a physical exam.
- If you have trouble finding time for an exam, talk to your doctor.

## Nutrition
- Postpartum mothers should be mindful of their iron and calcium intake. Iron-rich foods—such as lean meats, beans, and leafy greens—are important, particularly if you experienced blood loss during delivery. 
- Calcium is vital for bone health, especially if breastfeeding, so incorporate dairy products or fortified alternatives into your meals. 
- Ensuring you get adequate amounts of these nutrients can enhance your overall health and recovery.
