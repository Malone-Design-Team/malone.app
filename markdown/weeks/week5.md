# Week 5
## Your Body Postpartum
- Between 6 and 12 weeks after birth, be sure to contact your health care provider for a comprehensive postpartum evaluation.
- At this evaluation, they will discuss:
    - Your emotional well-being
    - Contraception or future pregnancies
    - Infant care and feeding
    - Your sleep habits
- They will also perform a physical exam.
- If you have trouble finding time for an exam, talk to your doctor.
