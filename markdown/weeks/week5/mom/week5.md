# Week 5

## Scheduling Check-up Appointments

Between 6 and 12 weeks after birth, be sure to contact your health care provider for a comprehensive postpartum evaluation. They will perform a physical exam, and likely discuss some of the following with you:

* Your emotional well-being
* Contraception or future pregnancies
* Infant care and feeding
* Your sleep habits

If you have trouble finding time for an exam, talk to your doctor.
