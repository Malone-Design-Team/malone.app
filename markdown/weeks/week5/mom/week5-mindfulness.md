Each week under this section, we will provide one or two mindfulness exercises for you to try. These help keep you in the moment with all the stress of caring for your newborn, regulate your emotions, and reduce your anxiety levels. Some may work better than others for you, so all of the exercises can be found in the Modules tab under “Mindfulness.”
