Starting this week and next week, depending on the advice of your medical provider, you may be able to resume sexual activities with your partner. However, there is a difference between medically ready and mentally ready! According to Cleveland Clinic, there are a lot of factors that play into whether you’re ready to have sex again, even if your doctor says you can physically. “There are biological things, like our hormones, our physical recovery, our breast tenderness and our fatigue. There are psychological things, like postpartum depression and baby blues. Not everyone feels their best when they haven’t had time to brush their teeth and have a shower. There are social things, like what it means for us to be a parent and how we interact with our partners in this new role.” [(link)](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sex-after-birth)

Then there’s just the normal aspect of being a new parent – it’s a lot to deal with when you have an infant depending on you for everything, night and day, and your new role can change what you have the energy to do. That is completely normal and perfectly acceptable! Make sure to talk to your partner about it so they understand where you’re at.
