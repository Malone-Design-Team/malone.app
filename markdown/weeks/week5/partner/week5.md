# Week 5
## Your Partner's Body Postpartum
- Between 6 and 12 weeks after birth, be sure to contact your partner's health care provider for a comprehensive postpartum evaluation.
- At this evaluation, they will discuss:
    - Your partner's emotional well-being
    - Contraception or future pregnancies
    - Infant care and feeding
    - Your partner's sleep habits
- They will also perform a physical exam.
- If your partner has trouble finding time for an exam, talk to their doctor.
