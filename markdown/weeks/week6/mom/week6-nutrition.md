Below are a few tips and tricks for nutrition for both yourself and your baby, as well as an easy recipe you can try if you aren’t sure what to cook.
- Practicing mindful eating is important during transitional times like this. Take time to enjoy your meals, savoring the flavors and textures, which can enhance your satisfaction and digestion.
- Additionally, be attentive to your body’s hunger and fullness signals; eat when you’re hungry, and stop when you’re satisfied, even if these signals fall at weird times.
- Limiting caffeine is also wise – try to keep it to moderate levels, especially while breastfeeding, to avoid any impact on your baby’s sleep.
