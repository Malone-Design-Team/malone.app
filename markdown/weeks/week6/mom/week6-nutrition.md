## Nutrition
- Practicing mindful eating is important during this transitional time. Take the time to enjoy your meals, savoring the flavors and textures, which can enhance your satisfaction and digestion.
- Additionally, be attentive to your body’s hunger and fullness signals; nourish yourself when hungry and stop when satisfied.
- Limiting caffeine is also wise—try to keep it to moderate levels, especially while breastfeeding, to avoid any impact on your baby’s sleep.
