## Mindfulness

These exercises help keep you in the moment with all the stress of caring for your newborn, regulate your emotions, and reduce your anxiety levels. Some may work better than others for you, so feel free to look for more and reference past exercises - all of them can be found in the Modules tab under “Mindfulness.”
