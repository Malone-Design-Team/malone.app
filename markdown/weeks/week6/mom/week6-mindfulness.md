Each week under this section, we will provide one or two mindfulness exercises for you to try. These help keep you in the moment with all the stress of caring for your newborn, regulate your emotions, and reduce your anxiety levels. Some may work better than others for you, so all of the exercises can be found in the Modules tab under “Mindfulness.”

- This technique is easy to do quietly, even in public, and can help reduce stress when you start to feel overwhelmed or anxious.
- Start by breathing in for four seconds.
- Hold your breath in for four seconds.
- Breathe out for four seconds.

- Repeat the process again for several more cycles or until you feel a little calmer.
