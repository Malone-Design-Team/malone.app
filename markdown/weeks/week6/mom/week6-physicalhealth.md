Around this time, your uterus should return to pre-pregnancy size and your bleeding should cease. If your bleeding has stopped and then suddenly resumes for a few days out of nowhere, that’s normal. It should cease again soon. You might be good to go for both exercise and sex, but it’s common to not want to have sex for a while still. And just because you’re able to exercise doesn’t mean you should push yourself. You’re well on the way to recovering, but you’re not done. Go easy. Exhaustion is normal, so take naps liberally. Your menstrual cycle could be back to normal, but if you’re breastfeeding, it will probably take longer. You might be losing some hair as your hormones return to normal.
