## Nutrition
- Practicing mindful eating is important during this transitional time. Encourage your partner to take the time to enjoy their meals, savoring the flavors and textures, which can enhance their satisfaction and digestion.
- Additionally, be attentive to your partner’s hunger and fullness signals; support them in nourishing themselves when hungry and stopping when satisfied.
- Limiting caffeine is also wise—try to help your partner keep it to moderate levels, especially while breastfeeding, to avoid any impact on your baby’s sleep.
