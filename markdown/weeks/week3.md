# Week 3
## Your Body Postpartum
- In the next few weeks, vaginal discharge will have less blood and will begin to taper off. It will turn from brown to yellow or white.

## Mental Health
- Anxiousness and mood swings following birth should subside within two weeks.
    - If you still find yourself experiencing these symptoms, talk to to your doctor.
    - If you are very tired, don’t feel like eating, have trouble with daily tasks, have large mood swings, or feel like harming yourself or your child, be sure to tell your doctor. These may be symptoms of postpartum depression.

## Nutrition
- Eating smaller, more frequent meals can help manage hunger and maintain energy throughout the day. Keep healthy snacks on hand—think yogurt, fruits, nuts, or whole-grain crackers—to fuel your body when needed. 
- This approach not only stabilizes blood sugar levels but also helps prevent fatigue, allowing you to better cope with the demands of motherhood.
