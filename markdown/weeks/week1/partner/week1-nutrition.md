- Ensuring your partner stays well-hydrated is essential for their postpartum recovery and breastfeeding. Encourage them to drink at least 8-10 cups of water daily, adjusting based on their individual needs and activity levels.
- Proper hydration not only supports their milk production but also helps maintain their energy levels during those demanding early days with a newborn.
- Help them incorporate herbal teas or infused water with fruits for added flavor and variety. Pay attention to their thirst cues and remind them to drink when they're thirsty to keep their fluid levels optimal.
