# Week 1
## What should I expect postpartum?
Your partner should contact their health care provider in the next 3 weeks to talk about their postpartum health. Like pregnancy, postpartum can affect many parts of the body. Some symptoms are expected, but you should contact the doctor if they are severe [Tap here to learn about common pregnancy-related complications.](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/staying-healthy-during-pregnancy/complications-of-pregnancy) Here's what to expect and when to be concerned:
- *Vaginal soreness* is common after a vaginal delivery.
- They may feel *contractions* (called afterpains) for a few days after delivery. They are common during breastfeeding.
- *Vaginal bleeding* will be heavy and bright red for the first few days. It will slowly get darker and more watery.
    - *Contact the doctor* if blood from the vagina soaks through a pad in an hour for two hours or more, especially if they also have a fever, pelvic pain or tenderness, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
- They may find that they *leak urine* when they sneeze, laugh, or cough. This will usually end after one week, but can last longer.
- They may feel *pain during bowel movements*, swelling near the anus, or swollen veins around the anus or lower rectum. Make sure they drink water and eat foods high in fiber.
- For about 5 months, they will *lose hair* faster than it grows.
- It’s common for them to still *look pregnant* after giving birth. Over the course of several days, they’ll lose weight from leftover fluids.
- *Stretch marks* can appear on the abdomen, breasts, hips, buttocks or other places on the body.
    - They can be black, blue, purple, pink, red, or discolored streaks.
    - They don’t need treatment and *fade over time*

## Breastfeeding
- For a few days after giving birth, your partner might have full, firm, sore breasts. They may breastfeed their baby often on both breasts to help keep them from overfilling.
