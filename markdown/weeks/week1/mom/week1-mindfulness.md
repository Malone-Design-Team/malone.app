##### Mindfulness

Each week under this section, we will provide one or two mindfulness exercises for you to try. These help keep you in the moment with all the stress of caring for your newborn, regulate your emotions, and reduce your anxiety levels. Some may work better than others for you, so all of the exercises can be found in the Modules tab under “Mindfulness.” 

**Weekly Exercise**: The Stimulating (or Bellows) Breath 
* This exercise is adapted from a yogic breathing technique. It aims to raise vital energy and increase alertness. Heads up, this is a noisy breathing exercise!
* Inhale and exhale rapidly through your nose, keeping your mouth closed but relaxed. Your breaths in and out should be equal in duration, but as short as possible.
* Try for three in-and-out breath cycles per second. This produces a quick movement of the diaphragm, suggesting a bellows. Breathe normally after each cycle.
* Do not do this for more than 15 seconds on your first try. Each time you practice the Stimulating Breath, you can increase your time by five seconds or so, until you reach a full minute.
* If done properly, you may feel invigorated, comparable to the heightened awareness you feel after a good workout. You should feel the effort at the back of the neck, the diaphragm, the chest and the abdomen. Try this breathing exercise the next time you need an energy boost and feel yourself reaching for a cup of coffee.
