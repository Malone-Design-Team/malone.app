# Week 1 Social Support
Having a new addition to the family can be exciting for everyone, but you need support from your loved ones during this time, not additional chaos. Some family members may be amazing at providing exactly that, but others may not be, and that can be a challenge to navigate. Let’s talk about two strategies for this: setting boundaries and asking for help.

First, setting boundaries. The most important part of this is recognizing that what you’re feeling, where you’re at, and what you need are ALL VALID. Talk this through with your partner, and find a few strategies that work best for both of you. Having a united front when you’re meeting up with family and friends means you can help each other out when your needs aren’t being met - not being alone in setting boundaries can be a game changer.

Last, asking for help. When you have a minute or two, think about who you can reach out to when you need something. Maybe it’s your best friend, maybe it’s a neighbor, maybe it’s one of your parents, or another family member. Make sure that reaching out to them is going to take a load of stress off of you and not add more, but don’t hesitate to reach out - it takes a village!
