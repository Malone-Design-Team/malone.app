###### Sexual Health

A lot of people wonder how soon after pregnancy you can start having sex again. Generally, it’s recommended that you wait anywhere from two to six weeks before resuming sexual activity, but this is a recommendation not a rule, is heavily based on the circumstances of your delivery, and will be up to you to decide on in the end. The risk of having sex in the early weeks following a pregnancy is infection, due to the initial healing still taking place in your body ([link](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/a-partners-guide-to-pregnancy#:~:text=When%20is%20it%20OK%20to,about%202%20weeks%20following%20birth)). Once your health care provider gives you the green light, you are free to do as you please. However, you should not feel pressured into resuming sexual activities before you’re ready to, even after you have the green light medically and physically speaking. Keep an open line of communication with your partner to share your thoughts and make sure you’re both on the same page.
