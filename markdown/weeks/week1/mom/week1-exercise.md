##### Exercise


**When is it safe to start?**
If you had a healthy pregnancy and normal vaginal delivery, experts say it is enough to wait a few days after birth to begin exercising. Mothers who had Cesarean birth or complications should ask their OBGYN, about when to begin exercising. However, it is important to mention what kind of exercise you engage in or are planning to engage in. Although the benefits of exercise are many, in the first weeks it is important to make sure you are properly recovered first. 

**Reframe what exercise means**
The ability to begin exercising again also depends on the kind of exercising you are doing.  Common types of exercises include:
- aerobics (movement of major muscle groups in a rhythmic way),
- Moderate intensity activity (brisk walking, riding a bike on a level surface) 
- Vigorous intensity activity (exercise that is hard to do without pausing for a breath) 
- Muscle strengthening workouts (Pilates, weightlifting, sit-ups, push-ups, Kegels)

**When to take a step back?**
Stop exercising if you feel pain, an appropriate amount of time to exercise is around 20-30 minutes, but even 10 minutes of exercise may be enough. It’s important to listen to your body and not overextend yourself in this period. If pain is severe, cease immediately and contact your OBGYN, or go to the emergency room if severe pain does not subside. 

**Why exercise**
Exercise in the postpartum period has several benefits including but not limited to: 
- Promoting better sleep
- Relieving stress
- Boosting energy
- Strengthening and toning abdominal muscles
- Possibly even preventing post-partum depression

**Overcoming the pressure to “get your body back”**
Weight gain during pregnancy is normal but also remains a common insecurity for some women after birth. It’s important to remember in this time that you are more than your body’s physical appearance and that fitness in the body is not wholly reflected in how much weight you have gained/loss or aesthetics.  
One article by Penn medicine states: **Remember all that your body has done and is doing for your baby.**
