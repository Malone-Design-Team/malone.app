#### Breastfeeding

For a few days after giving birth, you might have full, firm, sore breasts. Breastfeed your baby often on both breasts to help keep them from overfilling.

You may have heard that breastfeeding can serve as birth control. This is called Lactational Amenorrhea (LAM), and it is 98% effective for the first six months postpartum, provided that you strictly follow the necessary conditions: 

1. Your baby is under 6 months old. 
2. Your baby is fully or almost-fully breastfed.
3. Your period hasn’t returned. 

If one of the above conditions isn’t met, LAM won’t work. There are other limitations and nuances to LAM not mentioned here that would be best discussed with your healthcare provider to make sure it’s a good fit for you​.
