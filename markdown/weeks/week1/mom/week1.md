## What should I expect postpartum?
You should contact your health care provider in the next 3 weeks to talk about your postpartum health. Like pregnancy, postpartum can affect many parts of the body. Some symptoms are expected, but you should contact your doctor if they are severe [Tap here to learn about common pregnancy-related complications.](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/staying-healthy-during-pregnancy/complications-of-pregnancy) Here's what to expect and when to be concerned:
- *Vaginal soreness* is common after a vaginal delivery.
- You may feel *contractions* (called afterpains) for a few days after delivery. They are common during breastfeeding.
- *Vaginal bleeding* will be heavy and bright red for the first few days. It will slowly get darker and more watery.
    - *Contact your doctor* if blood from your vagina soaks through a pad in an hour for two hours or more, especially if you also have a fever, pelvic pain or tenderness, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
- You may find that you *leak urine* when you sneeze, laugh, or cough. This will usually end after one week, but can last longer.
- You may feel *pain during bowel movements*, swelling near your anus, or swollen veins around your anus or lower rectum. Make sure to drink water and eat foods high in fiber.
- For about 5 months, you will *lose hair* faster than it grows.
- It’s common to still *look pregnant* after giving birth. Over the course of several days, you’ll lose weight from leftover fluids.
- *Stretch marks* can appear on the abdomen, breasts, hips, buttocks or other places on the body.
    - They can be black, blue, purple, pink, red, or discolored streaks.
    - They don’t need treatment and *fade over time* on their own.
