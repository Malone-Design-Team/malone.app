### Your Mental Health

At least 10% of people struggle with depression and anxiety after giving birth (postpartum mood disorders). Keep an eye out for thisâ€”it's normal and nothing to be ashamed of but sometimes requires professional help. A few symptoms to watch out for include losing enjoyment in your normal interests and hobbies, anxiety seemingly without reason, tiredness (beyond the normal of being a parent!), and others. Sometimes mindfulness exercises can help - take a look at the Mindfulness section under the modules tab or in the weekly breakdown for some to try. If you believe that you may have postpartum depression, this screening [here](?tab=modules&module=mental-health/Postpartum-mood-screening.md) is used by professionals to help with diagnosis. 

If you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby, reach out for help. You can contact your doctor, a mental health professional, or call 988 (the emergency mental health line) in case of an immediate crisis.
