# Week 6
## Mental Health
- Now that it's been 6 weeks, doctors recommend that you check up on your mental health!
  - You may want to sit down and fill out the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale a second time. **[insert links]**

## Nutrition
- Practicing mindful eating is important during this transitional time. Take the time to enjoy your meals, savoring the flavors and textures, which can enhance your satisfaction and digestion. 
- Additionally, be attentive to your body’s hunger and fullness signals; nourish yourself when hungry and stop when satisfied. 
- Limiting caffeine is also wise—try to keep it to moderate levels, especially while breastfeeding, to avoid any impact on your baby’s sleep.
