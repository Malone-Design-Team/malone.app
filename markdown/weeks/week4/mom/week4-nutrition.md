### Nutrition

Below are a few tips and tricks for nutrition for both yourself and your baby, as well as an easy recipe you can try if you aren’t sure what to cook. 

* Incorporating protein-rich foods into your diet is crucial for recovery and satiety. Include sources like chicken, fish, eggs, legumes (like beans, lentils, peas, and soybeans), and dairy products.
* Healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil, are also essential as they provide sustained energy and aid in nutrient absorption.
* This combination helps keep you feeling full longer and supports your body’s healing processes.
