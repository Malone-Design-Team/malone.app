#### Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding can be hard, and it’s even possible for your nipples to crack. If your nipples are in pain, take care of them by applying lanolin (like Lasinoh) after feeding each time. Chilled wet tea bags can also be soothing ​(more [info](https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/month-by-month/))​. 

If your nipples are “pink, itchy, crusty or burning,” seek medical attention, since these are signs of thrush. You can also check your infant’s mouth for a cottage cheese-like coating on their tongue or cheeks, which is another symptom of thrush ​​(more [info](https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/month-by-month/))​. 

Whether you have thrush or your nipples are in pain, don’t stop breastfeeding. Ceasing to feed can lead to mastitis. Furthermore, as you continue feeding, your nipples will become more resilient and the pain should fade.
