##### Sexual Health

Around this time (three weeks after birth), it is possible to get pregnant again ([link](https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/parents/postpartum-recovery-timeline)). According to the National Office on Women’s Health, “getting pregnant too soon after giving birth can be risky for both you and your baby. Becoming pregnant again within a year of giving birth increases the chance that your new baby will be born too soon. Babies that are born too soon can have health problems.” ([link](https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/getting-pregnant-again))  Depending on your delivery and how it went, your health care provider may say you can start to resume sexual activities, so make sure you are using some form of birth control if so. This [site](https://www.fda.gov/media/150299/download) has more details on different types of birth control, but ask your doctor for more details as needed. 

So what determines when you can resume sexual activities? It depends on how you have birth (vaginal or c-section), and what may still be healing. According to Cleveland Clinic, if you had a vaginal delivery and “experienced tearing or heavy bruising over [your] vulva (the outside of your vagina), your provider will likely recommend abstaining from sex for six weeks.” The tissue in that area and any stitches/sutures you may have received need enough time to heal so that the tissue isn’t re-injured during intercourse or oral sex. Similar suggestions apply for any who had a c-section delivery. Your doctor will likely recommend that you abstain from sex for at least six weeks to allow your incision time to heal and allow your cervix to recover from any dilations ([link](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sex-after-birth)). 

On the other hand, Cleveland Clinic says that “if you had a tear-free vaginal delivery and no other complications, your provider may say you can resume sexual activity as soon as two weeks after giving birth if you so choose.” Again, this decision is up to you – don't feel pressured to start having sex again as soon as your doctor gives the green light and communicate with your partner about this.
