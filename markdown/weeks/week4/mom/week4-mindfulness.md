## Mindfulness

These exercises help keep you in the moment with all the stress of caring for your newborn, regulate your emotions, and reduce your anxiety levels. Some may work better than others for you, so feel free to look for more and reference past exercises - all of them can be found in the Modules tab under “Mindfulness.”

**Weekly Exercise**: Body Scan 

* Find a place to lie down and stretch out in a comfortable position. Allow your eyes to close, and take a few deep, slow breaths to relax.
* Starting from the bottom of your body, slowly scan upwards, noticing any tension or discomfort.
* Breath into each area. Notice and acknowledge the sensations you feel in each part. Stretch them, wiggle them a little, and relax them as you go.
* The goal of this exercise is to focus on each part of your body individually to help ease tension from it. Being intentional about that focus and that stretch can help you quiet your thoughts and stay in the present moment.
* Sometimes this strategy is hard to use during the day, so try using it before you get out of the bed in the morning, or to relax right before you go to sleep (before a nap or at night).
