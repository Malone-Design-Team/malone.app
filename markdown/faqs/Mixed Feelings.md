### Q: Is it okay to have mixed feelings about motherhood? 

A: Yes, itâ€™s both acceptable and normal. As cheesy as it may sound, acknowledging your feelings and accepting them is the first step to coping. Ambivalence about being a mother or even resentment are common, and you don't need to feel guilty if you don't feel a close connection with your baby right off the bat. Everyone experiences parenthood differently and having mixed feelings does not mean that you don't love your child.
