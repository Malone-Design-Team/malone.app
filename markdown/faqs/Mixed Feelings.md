### Q: Is it okay to have mixed feelings about motherhood? 

A: Yes, itâ€™s both acceptable and normal. As cheesy as it may sound, acknowledging and accepting your feelings is the first step to coping. Ambivalence about being a mother or even resentment is common, and you don't need to feel guilty if you don't feel a close connection with your baby right off the bat.

Everyone experiences parenthood differently, and having mixed feelings does not mean you don't love your child. It's a normal response to the often overwhelming demands of parenting. Try not to bottle up these feelings and instead share them with others. Most mothers feel the same way, even if it can be intimidating to talk about it openly.
