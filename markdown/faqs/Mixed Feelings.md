### Q: Is it okay to have mixed feelings about motherhood? 

A: Yes, itâ€™s both acceptable and normal. As cheesy as it may sound, acknowledging your feelings and accepting them is the first step to coping. Ambivalence about being a mother or even resentment are common, and you don't need to feel guilty for feeling that way. Remember that your hormonal levels are still all over the place, that mental health issues postpartum are frequent, and that motherhood is hard.
