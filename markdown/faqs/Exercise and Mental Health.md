### Q: How important is physical activity for my mental health? 

A: Very important! Regular physical activity releases endorphins, which can reduce stress and improve mood. It can help you sleep better and lowers your risk of postpartum depression **[link to module on postpartum mood disorders]**.

Don't feel pressured to begin high-intensity activities right away. This could increase your risk of prolapse, where an organ moves out of place in the body. Instead, focus on low- and moderate-intensity activities.

The CDC recommends moderate-intensity physical activities for the first year after giving birth. They suggest at least 150 minutes per week, but any amount of activity is helpful if you don't have time. Here are some examples of moderate physical activities:
- brisk walking
- water aerobics
- bike riding
- yoga

Doing these activities with a group can make them more enjoyable and social activies are beneficial to your mental health!
