### Q: How important is physical activity for my mental health? 

A: Regular physical activity releases endorphins, which can reduce stress and improve mood. It can help you sleep better and lowers your risk of postpartum depression. [Tap here to read more about postpartum mood disorders.](?tab=modules&module=mental-health/Postpartum-mood-screening.md).

However, don't begin high-intensity activities right away. This could increase your risk of prolapse, where an organ moves out of place in the body. The CDC recommends moderate-intensity physical activities for the first year after giving birth. They suggest at least 150 minutes per week, but any amount of activity is helpful if you don't have time. Here are some examples of moderate physical activities:
- brisk walking
- water aerobics
- bike riding
- yoga

Doing these activities with others can make them even more enjoyable. Social connection is so important for your mental health. It can lift your mood, ease stress, and remind you that youâ€™re supported. Even a small chat with another parent can make a big difference in your day.
