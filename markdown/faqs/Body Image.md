### Q: How can I cope with body image changes postpartum? 

A: Please try not to compare yourself to others—especially the pictures and stories you see on social media. Be gentle and patient with yourself. Your body has been through so much and needs time to heal after giving birth.  

Rather than focusing on how your body looks, try to notice all the amazing things it can do. Whether or not you breastfeed, your body lets you hug, hold, comfort, and play with your baby—that's truly incredible.  

Instead of aiming to "get back" to how things were before, try to honor your body for what it is now and everything it’s helped you do. You deserve kindness and grace, especially from yourself.  

If you're struggling, you're not alone. Reach out to people who can support you—people who will remind you of your strength and help you feel confident in your own beautiful skin.
