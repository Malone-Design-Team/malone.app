### Q: How can I cope with body image changes postpartum? 

A: It is very common to feel a disconnect with your postpartum body due to the many physical changes that come with pregnancy and childbirth. This can happen even if you've been pregnant before. Each experience with pregnancy is unique.

Focus on what your body can do rather than how it looks. Whether or not you breastfeed, your body lets you hug, hold, care for, or play with your baby. Your body needs time to heal after giving birth. Instead of trying to "get back" the way your body may have looked before, try to embrace your body for what it is and all that it's done for you. Talk to other people that can support you in finding self-confidence in your own skin.
