### Q: How can I find time to bond with my baby? 

## A: Here are some resources to consider creating a better bond with your baby. Find the one that works best for you.

### Turn Everyday Tasks into Bonding Moments
- Consider incorporating your infant into your daily routine.
- Diaper changes, feedings, and bath time can all be moments of eye contact, soft talking, singing, or gentle touch.

### Skin-to-Skin Contact
- Especially in the early months, skin-to-skin helps both you and your baby feel calm and connected.
- It doesn’t have to be long—just a few minutes here and there can have a powerful effect.

### Babywearing
- Using a sling or baby carrier lets you keep your baby close while you move around, get things done, or even take a walk together.

### Read, Sing, or Hum
- Even if they don’t understand the words yet, the rhythm of your voice and your presence makes them feel safe and loved.

### Cuddle & Nap Together (Safely)
- If you can, rest with your baby nearby. Those snuggles and quiet moments matter deeply.

### Take Breaks When You Can
- If someone offers to help with chores or errands, take that moment to just be with your baby without distractions—even just 10 minutes.

### Let Go of “Perfect”
- You don’t need to be doing everything “right.” Just being there, even on tough days, builds trust and love.
