### Q: What should I do if Iâ€™m struggling to connect with my baby? 

A: Connection can grow over time. It's okay if you don't feel a deep connection with your baby right away. It's normal for a bond to develop gradually over the first year of your baby's life. Here are some ways to bond with your baby **[link to source: https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/bonding-with-your-newborn-heres-what-to-know-if-you-dont-feel-connected-right-away]**:

- Have skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Touch or stroke their skin.
- If you breastfeed, this can help make time to touch and hold your baby.
- Look at your baby. Talk or sing to them.
- Pick up and soothe your baby when they cry. You can't spoil a newborn.

Don't feel guilty if you don't immediately feel a close connection during these activites. The first few weeks after giving birth can bring a lot of stress, sadness, or anger. These feeling can make bonding more difficult, but it will likely become easier as they pass. Try talking to friends and family members. If you're still concerned about difficulties connecting to your baby, talk to a doula, doctor, or other health professional.
