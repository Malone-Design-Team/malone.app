### Q: How can I maintain my physical health postpartum? 

A: 

#### Rest and Recover First
- Your body needs time to heal—especially in the first 6 weeks.
- Try to sleep when you can, and don’t feel guilty about prioritizing rest over anything else.
- Listen to your body; if something feels off or painful, reach out to a healthcare provider.

#### Nourish Yourself with Healthy Foods
- Try to eat regular meals with a mix of protein, fiber, healthy fats, and plenty of water.
- If you're breastfeeding, your body needs even more fuel—don’t skimp on calories.
- Keep easy, nourishing snacks nearby: nuts, fruit, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, etc.

#### Gentle Movement When You're Ready
- Once cleared by your provider (often around 6 weeks), start with gentle activities like:
  - Walking
  - Stretching
  - Postnatal yoga or Pilates
- These support circulation, boost energy, and reduce stress—no need to rush into intense workouts.

#### Stay Hydrated
- Water helps with healing, energy levels, and milk production if you're breastfeeding.
- Keep a water bottle with you—especially near where you feed the baby or rest.

#### Care for Your Core and Pelvic Floor
- Your abdominal muscles and pelvic floor go through a lot during pregnancy and birth.
- A pelvic floor physical therapist can help with healing, especially if you notice:
  - Leakage
  - Pain during sex
  - A feeling of pressure or heaviness

#### Attend Postpartum Checkups
- Don't skip your follow-up appointments—even if you feel okay. They’re important to monitor healing, mood, and overall health.
- Be honest with your provider about how you’re feeling, physically and emotionally.

#### Be Kind to Yourself
- Your body may look and feel different—and that’s okay. It’s done something powerful.
- Celebrate what your body has done, and give it the compassion it deserves.
