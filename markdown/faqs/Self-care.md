### Q: How important is self-care for new moms? 

A: Extremely important! Taking time for yourself can recharge your mental health and help you be a better caregiver. Below are some areas to focus on:
- **Sleep and rest.** Giving birth is taxing. Take naps liberally and give your body plenty of time to rest. The road to recovery is long.
- **Nutrition and hydration.** Eat healthy meals and drink a good amount of water. [Tap here](?tab=modules&module=nutrition/recipes) to view some recipes you can make.
- **Exercise.** Do not do anything strenuous, but don't do nothing, either. Walking and yoga are good examples of light exercise you can do to take care of yourself.
- **Mindfulness.** Meditation, thankfulness, and other activities to center your mind can be helpful. [Tap here](?tab=modules&module=mindfulness) to learn more.
- **Social support.** It takes a village to raise a child, and Malone is ready to help you on your motherhood journey. Don't feel bad for asking for help from your parter and friend. [Tap here](?tab=modules&module=social-support) to learn more about social support opportunities.

Don't feel guilty about taking time for yourself. You will be a better parent when you're healthy; an unhealthy momma can make for an unhealthy child. If you're strapped for time, just try to take 10-15 minutes a day for mindfulness. If you are struggling with postpartum mood disorders, reach out for support.
