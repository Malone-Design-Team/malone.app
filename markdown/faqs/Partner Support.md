### Q: How can partners support new mothers emotionally? 

A: Encourage open communication and listen without judgment. Emotional support is key. Check in with your partner often and ask how they are feeling. If they're overwhelmed, give them a break by caring for the baby for a while.

Here's some things you can do to help ease your partner's stress:
- Help with chores / household tasks
- Make meals and buy groceries
- Help your partner get some more sleep by taking care of the baby at night or early in the morning
- Help change daipers or wash bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts
