### Q: Is it normal to experience night sweats and increased body odor after childbirth?

A: Yes, it is common for new mothers to experience night sweats and changes in body odor during the postpartum period. These symptoms are often due to hormonal fluctuations, particularly the drop in estrogen levels, which can cause excessive sweating as your body eliminates the extra fluids retained during pregnancy. Usually, these symptoms are temporary and should subside within a few weeks. To help manage them, make sure to stay hydrated and wear breathable fabrics.
