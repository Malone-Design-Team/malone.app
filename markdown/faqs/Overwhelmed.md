### Q: Is it normal to feel overwhelmed after childbirth? 

A: Becoming a parent is one of life’s biggest transitions, and it often comes with more surprises and challenges than anyone expects.

Suddenly, you’re caring for a new little life while also navigating changes in your own body, sleep patterns, daily routines, and even your relationships. The emotional, physical, and financial shifts can all feel like a lot—because they are.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, please know this: that feeling is valid, and it’s incredibly common. You are not failing. You’re adjusting to something completely new—and doing your best in a season that demands so much.
