### How soon after giving birth can I have sex?
While there is no standard required waiting period, many providers recommend waiting six weeks before resuming sexual activity due to an infection risk in the early weeks following delivery as well as giving time for initial healing to take place.

The decision to resume sexual activity should be based on how you feel as well as following recommendations from your health care provider. Just because you’ve received the “green light” from your provider, does not mean you have to have sex. Wait until you’re ready and communicate with your partner.
