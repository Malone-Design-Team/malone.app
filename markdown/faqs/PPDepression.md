### Q: What are the signs of postpartum depression? 

A: Some feelings of stress, anxiety, sadness, or tiredness are expected after giving birth, but if these feelings are severe or don't go away within the first few weeks, they may be a sign of pospartum depression (PPD). According to the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/topics/women-girls/postpartum-depression), you should consider talking to your doctor about PPD if you have these symptoms for longer than 2 weeks:
- A loss of pleasure or interest in things you used to enjoy, including sex
- Eating much more, or much less, than you usually do
- Anxiety—all or most of the time—or panic attacks
- Racing, scary thoughts
- Feeling guilty or worthless; blaming yourself
- Excessive irritability, anger, or agitation; mood swings
- Sadness, crying uncontrollably for very long periods of time
- Fear of not being a good mother
- Fear of being left alone with the baby
- Misery
- Inability to sleep, sleeping too much, difficulty falling or staying asleep
- Disinterest in the baby, family, and friends
- Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, or making decisions
- Thoughts of hurting yourself or the baby
