### Q: What should I do if I’m feeling isolated? 

A: It’s completely understandable to feel isolated after having a baby. Social support is [crucial during this time](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8197355/). Having a child may mark a change in identity; you may feel disconnected from friends or family as you devote more time to caring for your child, or you may miss the opportunity to spend time with coworkers if you've taken maternity leave. Whatever the reason, it is common to feel isolated after having a child.

Many new moms worry about being seen as a “bad mother” if they’re struggling—and that fear can make it hard to reach out. You might feel like you have to appear strong, put together, or endlessly joyful, even when that’s far from how you're actually feeling.

But please know this: struggling doesn’t make you a bad mother. It makes you human.

You are not alone, and you don’t have to go through this by yourself. Building or maintaining social connections—especially in this season of life—can make a huge difference for your emotional well-being. Even small steps toward connection can help you feel seen, supported, and less alone. Here are a few gentle ways to start:

### Reach out to a friend or family member.
A quick message, call, or visit can remind you that people care and want to be there for you—even if you’re not sure what to say.

### Join a local moms' or parents' group.
Sharing space with others who truly understand what you're going through can be incredibly comforting. Many moms find deep friendships in these groups.
