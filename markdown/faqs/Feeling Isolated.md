### Q: What should I do if I’m feeling isolated? 

A: Social support is [crucial during this time](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8197355/). Having a child may mark a change in identity, you may feel disconnected from friends or family as you devote more time to caring for your child, or you may miss the opportunity to spend time with coworkers if you've taken maternity leave. Whatever the reason, it is common to feel isolated after having a child.

Many people feel worried about being judged as a "bad mother" and this fear can make it tempting to withdraw from others. Try to build and maintain social connections. Reach out to friends or family, join a local mom’s group, contact Malone, or connect online.
