### Q: How can I handle feelings of guilt as a new mom? 

A: It's normal to feel ["mom guilt"](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/mom-guilt), especially as a new mom. The internet and social media have only made it harder to avoid being bombarded by the many conflicting opinions people have about what it means to be a good mother or a bad one. Since, pressure can come from friends and family as well, it's no surprise that many people struggle to stay confident in themeselves and their parenting after having a child.

Instead of comparing yourself to other moms, learn to parent in your own way. Is the guilt you're feeling because you've really done something wrong, or is it because you've been burdened with unreasonable expectations. You don't have to be perfectly self-sacrficing to be a good mother. Try to take some time for yourself, too. Feeling guilty only adds another layer of stress.

Try to remember that other moms are facing struggles as well. It's important to support each other to truly get passed unecessary guilt.
