### Q: What should I do if I’m struggling to connect with my baby? 

A: Connection can grow over time. It's okay if you don't feel a deep connection with your baby right away. It's normal for a bond to develop gradually over the first year of your baby's life. Here are some [ways to bond with your baby](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/bonding-with-your-newborn-heres-what-to-know-if-you-dont-feel-connected-right-away):

- Have skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Touch or stroke their skin.
- If you breastfeed, this can help make time to touch and hold your baby.
- Look at your baby. Talk or sing to them.
- Pick up and soothe your baby when they cry. 

Please don’t be hard on yourself if you don’t feel an immediate connection during bonding moments. The early weeks after giving birth can be filled with so many emotions—stress, sadness, even anger—and it’s okay if those feelings make bonding feel harder at times.

You’re not alone, and there’s nothing wrong with you. Many parents go through this. Often, as time passes and things begin to settle, that connection starts to grow naturally.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, reaching out can help—whether it’s talking with a trusted friend, a family member, or someone who understands what you're going through. And if you’d like extra support, doulas, doctors, or other caring professionals are there to help guide you through it.
