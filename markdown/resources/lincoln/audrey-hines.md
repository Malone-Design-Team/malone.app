# Audrey Hines

Audrey has a passion for helping women, especially moms.  As a mom of three and a wife for over 10 years, she understands the reality of “mom burn-out.”  Audrey helps women in all stages of motherhood gain insight in themselves while deepening relationships with their partners and kids. With training in perinatal mood disorders, she is equipped to help moms navigate the emotional and physiological changes that are part of pregnancy and the post-partum period. Audrey also loves helping couples navigate the challenges that come up in marriage. She utilizes her Gottman training to help couples improve communication, reconnect, and build a deeper friendship.

Audrey is available exclusively via telehealth.
